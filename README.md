# Ionic-2-Upload
Demo of Ionic 2 upload app based on <a href="https://github.com/dtaalbers/ionic-2-examples">dtaalbers/ionic-2-examples</a> which was build on Ionic 2 RC0. I wanted to get it working on RC2. dtaalbers was going to update it. I figured I save him some time and upload my edits. I got rid of most of the errors and now it'll build on Ionic 2 RC2. But Open camera and Open album buttons still won't work. Looking into that.

Here is my system setup:

- Cordova CLI: 6.3.1
- Ionic Framework Version: 2.0.0-rc.2
- Ionic CLI Version: 2.1.4
- Ionic App Lib Version: 2.1.2
- Ionic App Scripts Version: 0.0.39
- Node Version: v6.9.1
