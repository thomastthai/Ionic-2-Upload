# Ionic-2-Upload
Demo of Ionic 2 upload app based on <a href="https://github.com/dtaalbers/ionic-2-examples">dtaalbers/ionic-2-examples</a> which was build on Ionic 2 RC0. I wanted to get it working on RC2. dtaalbers was going to update it. I figured I save him some time and upload my edits. I got rid of most of the errors and now it'll build on Ionic 2 RC2. Make sure you add in all the Cordova plugins, else the "Open camera" and "Open albums" buttons won't do anything.

- ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-splashscreen
- ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-statusbar
- ionic plugin add ionic-plugin-keyboard
- ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-camera
- ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-file-transfer
- ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-file

Here is my system setup:

- Cordova CLI: 6.3.1
- Ionic Framework Version: 2.0.0-rc.2
- Ionic CLI Version: 2.1.4
- Ionic App Lib Version: 2.1.2
- Ionic App Scripts Version: 0.0.39
- Node Version: v6.9.1
